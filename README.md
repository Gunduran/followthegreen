Follow the green, an X-Plane ATC A-SMGCS experience
Additions by Gunduran (Detlev Hoffmann)

Ideas:
* Load of Airport Data in a separate process ==> Done, main dialog shows loading until the load is finished, need some more testing for airports without taxiways etc.
  
* Move from the old style windows to the new styles (also dragable outside x-plane frame) and list all the destinations in combination with typing the first digits

* draw a map of the taxiways and destinations and make it click / selectable 

* Enter ATC routing information (e.g. you've landed in EDDK on 14L and exited via A3 and want to go to B12, ATC might advise me to use E A5 B or A B
  this should be done using a scratchpad where you start entering by keyboard the first possible digits (in the example above if you stand A3 and you enter E it will be 
  then A4 or A5 possible or if you enter A it will be B (perhaps also A4 E A5)
